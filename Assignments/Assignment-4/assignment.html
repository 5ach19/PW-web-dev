    <!-- Accessibility in web development is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible. It involves designing 
    and developing websites and web technologies so that people with disabilities can use them. Accessibility also benefits other groups,
    such as those using mobile devices or those with slow network connections.

    Accessibility is important because it provides equal access to everyone, especially people with disabilities. 
    It also promotes usability.
 
    Accessible design improves access to information on the web for individuals with and without disabilities. Well-designed, accessible websites
    expedite the delivery of information and services. 
 
    Accessibility is important for: 
  
    1.Ensuring that people who need accessible technology can participate equally in class, when previewing university course offerings,
    or while they are working.

    2.Ensuring that all potential users, including people with disabilities, have a decent user experience and are able to easily access 
    information.
      
    3.Improved User Experience: Accessibility often leads to an improved user experience for all users.

    4.Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Accessible websites tend to perform better in search engine rankings.
        Search engines, like Google, prioritize websites that provide a good user experience, which includes accessibility considerations.


    Benefits for Different User Groups:

    1.Visually Impaired Users: Accessible websites provide screen reader users with accurate and organized content,
    including text alternatives for images, proper heading structures, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes.
    This allows visually impaired users to navigate, understand, and interact with web content effectively.

    2.Deaf or Hard of Hearing Users: Accessible websites include closed captions and transcripts for multimedia content,
    making audio and video information accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing.

    3.Elderly Users: As people age, they may experience changes in vision, hearing, and motor skills. 
    Accessible design helps elderly users maintain their independence and access information online comfortably. -->

    <!-- Improving the accessibility of HTML5 involves implementing various techniques and best practices.
    Here are three ways to enhance accessibility in HTML5.

    1. Semantic HTML Elements: Use semantic HTML5 elements appropriately to structure your content. Semantic elements like <header>, 
    <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> provide meaningful structure to your web page,
    making it easier for assistive technologies and search engines to understand the content.
    Properly marking up headings with <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc., also helps users navigate the page and understand its hierarchy.

    2.Alternative Text for Images: Always include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the alt attribute in 
    the <img> element. Alt text should convey the purpose and content of the image, especially for users who cannot see the image.
    This is essential for screen reader users and users with slow internet connections, as it provides context when images fail to load.

    3. Use ARIA Roles-ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
    It helps you make dynamic content more accessible.
    ARIA roles and attributes provide more information or context about a website element to screen readers and other assistive tools.
    You can add the ARIA role using a role=”<ROLE TYPE>” attribute. -->
