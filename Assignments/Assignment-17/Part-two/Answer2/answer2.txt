Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Answer- HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Purpose: HTML is a markup language used for structuring the content of web pages. It provides the basic layout and defines the elements on a webpage like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
</body>
</html>



JavaScript:

Purpose: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and behavior to web pages. It allows manipulation of HTML and CSS, responding to user actions, performing calculations, handling events, and more.

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic elements within web pages.
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else


Example Usage:

Use JavaScript to create interactive elements like pop-ups, form validations, sliders, and animations.

Example of changing text using JavaScript
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello, JavaScript!';
