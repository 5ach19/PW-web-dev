Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.


The comma operator in JavaScript allows multiple expressions to be evaluated within a single statement. It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost expression.

Its syntax is simple: expression1, expression2, expression3, ...

example - 

let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

let result = (a++, b++, c++);

console.log(result); // Output: 3 (value of c after the comma operator)
console.log(a, b, c); // Output: 2 3 4 (values of a, b, c after incrementing)

a++ increments the value of a by 1.
b++ increments the value of b by 1.
c++ increments the value of c by 1.
The comma operator here evaluates each expression and returns the value of the rightmost expression (c++), which is the value of c after incrementing by 1.
