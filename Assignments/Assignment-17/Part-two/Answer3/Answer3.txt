List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Answer-

Certainly! In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types:

1.Number: Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers. It includes whole numbers as well as decimals.

Example:
let integerNumber = 10;
let floatingNumber = 3.14;


2.String: Represents textual data enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. Strings are used to store sequences of characters.

Example:
let text = 'Hello, World!';


3.Boolean: Represents a logical entity, either true or false. Booleans are used in conditions and comparisons.

Example:
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;


4.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. When a variable is declared without initialization, its default value is undefined.

Example:
let uninitializedVar;
console.log(uninitializedVar); // Output: undefined


5.Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value or an empty value. It's often used to explicitly indicate that a variable doesn't have a value.

Example:
let emptyValue = null;

6.Symbol: Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the Symbol data type represents a unique and immutable value that may be used as the key of an Object property.

Example- 
const sym1 = Symbol();
const sym2 = Symbol('description'); // Optional description

7.BigInt: Introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11), BigInt is a numeric primitive data type that allows representation of integers with arbitrary precision, not limited by the 53-bit storage limit of the Number type.

Example- 
const bigIntValue = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
