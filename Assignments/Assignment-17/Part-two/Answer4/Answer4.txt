Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the'let' keyword?

Answer- 

Allocation of Memory: When you declare a variable, you allocate memory space in the computer's memory to store a value. This allows you to hold and manipulate data in your programs.

Assignment and Storage: Variables act as containers that hold values, which can be assigned, updated, and retrieved during the execution of a program.

Scope Control: Variables can have different scopes (local or global), determining where they can be accessed or modified within a program. This helps in organizing and managing the flow of data in your code.

To declare variables in JavaScript using the let keyword:

let variableName;

let: This is a keyword introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) used for variable declaration. It allows the creation of a variable that can be reassigned a value later and has block scope.

variableName: This is the identifier or name of the variable you want to declare. It can be almost any valid variable name following JavaScript's naming conventions.

let age; // Declares a variable named 'age' without assigning a value yet
age = 25; // Assigns the value 25 to the variable 'age'


 also combine declaration and assignment in a single line:
 let greeting = "Hello!"; // Declares a variable 'greeting' and assigns the value "Hello!"
