Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Answer- 
Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript greatly enhances code readability and maintainability for several reasons:

Understanding Intent: Clear variable names convey the purpose and intent of the variable. They make it easier for other developers (and yourself) to understand what the variable represents or stores.

Reduced Cognitive Load: Descriptive names reduce the mental effort required to comprehend the code. Instead of spending time deciphering cryptic or vague names, developers can quickly grasp the role of a variable.

Easier Maintenance: When revisiting or maintaining code, descriptive names make it simpler to identify the purpose of variables, reducing the chances of introducing errors due to misunderstandings.


let a = 10;
let b = 5;

// vs

let numberOfApples = 10;
let pricePerApple = 5;

In the first example, a and b don't provide much context about what they represent. However, in the second example, numberOfApples and pricePerApple clearly indicate the purpose of each variable.
