Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

Answer-
Code Documentation: They serve as a means to document code, explaining its functionality, purpose, and usage. This helps other developers (and your future self) understand the codebase better.

Clarity and Readability: Comments improve the readability of code by providing context, explanations, and clarifications about complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Comments can also be used for debugging purposes, such as temporarily disabling code segments or adding notes for future debugging sessions.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
let number = 10; // This comment explains the variable initialization


Multi-line comments: These start with /* and end with */, allowing comments to span multiple lines.

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript.
   It can cover multiple lines of code or explanations.
   Useful for adding detailed descriptions.
*/
let result = performCalculation(); /* This comment explains a function call */
